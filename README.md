Video Wars 2084 Redux
=====================

This has to be the third or fourth iteration of this game.  The history is something like this:
1. Class project with Ben Crist, Josh Douglas and Jordan Buehler using C++.
   + We overscoped and I had to rush over the course of a week and a half to get something playable
   + Not terrible, but could be better
2. First Unity attempt
   + Using 3D, but just not useable
3. Second Unity attempt
   + Using 2D for the Herzing University (Madison campus) arcade cabinet
   + Multiplayer (2 player vs)
   + Works but has bugs
   + Almost complete, but the code is a little convoluted
4. This attempt
   + A little cleaner, application of lessons learned from previous Unity attempts
   + Shaders instead of sprites for Player, Bullet, and Platform effects
   + Single player, using waves of enemies (similar to Joust, I guess)
